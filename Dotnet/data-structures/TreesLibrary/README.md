# Trees and BinarySearchTrees
This Data Structure demonstrates how a tree is constructed. Also how to move through a tree in PreOrder, InOrder and PostOrder fashions. 

## Challenge
1. Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
1. Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
1. Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
1. Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
1. Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
1. Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal

## Approach & Efficiency
- Tree.PreOrder(root) - Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)
- Tree.InOrder(root) - Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)
- Tree.PostOrder(root) - Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)

## API
- Tree.PreOrder()
- Tree.InOrder()
- Tree.PostOrder()
